Synthetic Graph Generation
==========================

This module contains the implementation of the duplication-divergence model,
both considering only duplication and divergence, and also considering the
possibility of connecting the duplicated node to other nodes not connected to
it.

It is based on the following paper:

Pastor-Satorras R, Smith E, Sol√© RV. *Evolving protein interaction networks
through gene duplication*. J Theor Biol. 2003 May 21;222(2):199-210. doi:
10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00028-6.
